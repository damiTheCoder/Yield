# Hunt Page Bug Fixes & Updates

## Latest Update: Difficulty Balancing

### **Making the Hunt More Challenging** ðŸŽ¯
**Change:** Only 35% of revealed boxes actually contain tokens (~112 out of 320 boxes)

**How It Works:**
- Players can open any box to see its coordinate
- They must enter the coordinate to attempt claiming
- **NEW:** Not all coordinates contain tokens!
- If a coordinate has no token: "No token at [coord]. Keep searching!"
- If a coordinate has a token: Successfully claimed and added to wallet

**Difficulty Balance:**
- **Not Too Easy**: Players need to search through multiple boxes
- **Not Too Hard**: ~35% success rate means every 3rd box on average has a token
- **Strategic**: Players learn patterns and improve over time

**Benefits:**
- More engaging gameplay - requires actual hunting
- Increased replay value - each asset has different winning coordinates
- Better risk/reward balance
- Still achievable - enough winning boxes to complete the hunt

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Box Glitching Issue**
**Problem:** When clicking boxes, they would glitch and flicker due to unnecessary re-renders.

**Root Cause:** 
- Using `useMemo` for initial state was causing conflicts
- Auto-save effect was triggering on every state change
- Effect was reloading progress from storage, causing state conflicts

**Solution:**
- Removed the auto-save `useEffect` that ran on every change
- Changed to manual save using `setTimeout` after state updates complete
- Used functional state updates in `handleReveal` to prevent race conditions
- Wrapped handlers in `useCallback` to prevent recreation on every render
- Changed button `key` from `${coord}-${index}` to just `coord` for stable identity
- Added early return in `handleReveal` to prevent duplicate reveals

### 2. **Coordinate Input Not Working**
**Problem:** Input field was not responding or couldn't enter text.

**Potential Causes Addressed:**
- Ensured `inputValue` state is properly managed
- Added `useCallback` to `handleSubmit` to stabilize the function reference
- Confirmed input has proper `value` and `onChange` handlers
- Both desktop and mobile inputs are properly wired

**Solution:**
- Wrapped `handleSubmit` in `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- Used `setTimeout` to defer save operations, preventing input blocking
- Ensured state updates don't interfere with input focus/value

## Technical Improvements

### State Management
```typescript
// Before: Caused re-render glitches
useEffect(() => {
  updateHuntProgress(assetId, {
    revealed: Array.from(revealed),
    matched: Array.from(matched),
    foundTokens,
  });
}, [assetId, revealed, matched, foundTokens, updateHuntProgress]);

// After: Deferred save prevents blocking
setTimeout(() => {
  updateHuntProgress(assetId, {
    revealed: Array.from(nextRevealed),
    matched: Array.from(matched),
    foundTokens,
  });
}, 0);
```

### Button Rendering
```typescript
// Before: Unstable key caused React reconciliation issues
key={`${coord}-${index}`}

// After: Stable key prevents unnecessary re-renders
key={coord}
```

### Handler Optimization
```typescript
// Before: Recreated on every render
const handleReveal = (coordinate: string) => { ... }

// After: Memoized with useCallback
const handleReveal = useCallback((coordinate: string) => { ... }, [deps])
```

### Visual Improvements
- Added checkmark (âœ“) to matched boxes
- Added `disabled` prop to matched boxes
- Added proper cursor states (pointer, default, not-allowed)
- Improved button interaction feedback

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Prevented state update race conditions
- Stable component identity in React's reconciliation
- Optimized handler references

## Testing Checklist
âœ… Click boxes - should reveal smoothly without glitching
âœ… Type in input field - should accept text normally
âœ… Submit coordinates - should validate and claim tokens
âœ… Matched boxes show checkmarks
âœ… Progress saves and persists on refresh
âœ… Mobile input works at bottom of screen
âœ… Desktop input works in main area
